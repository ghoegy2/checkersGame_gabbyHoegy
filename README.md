Description:

This project is a virtual checkers board game that was created using Java. It is runnable using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2024.1.1 (IDE),
JDK17 (programming language), and Junit 4.12 (testing framework). This game was my semester-long project for my CPSC 2150 class.

-------------------------------------------------

How to Compile and Run:

1. Ensure that IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2024.1.1, JDK17, and Junit 4 are installed on your machine.
2. On the GitHub repository page, navigate to the "<> Code" button and click "Download ZIP". Extract the project files into a new folder.
3. Open the new folder in IntelliJ, and navigate to the "Project Structure" settings. Add and apply JDK17 to the "SDKs" section located
   under "Platform Settings".
4. In the "Project Structure" settings, locate the "Libraries" section under "Project Settings". Add and apply Junit 4.12.
5. In IntelliJ, expand the "views" project folder and open the "CheckersFE.java" file. Ensure "CheckersFE.java" is your current file.
6. Ensure "CheckersFE.java" is selected as your current file. The dropdown in the top right corner of the screen should say "Current File".
7. Click on the green arrow button (located to the right of "Current File") to compile and run the game. The game will open in an IntelliJ
   terminal. :)
